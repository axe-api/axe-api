# Versioning Policy

Axe API uses the semantic version system.

## Overview

Semantic versioning is a numbering system used in software development to indicate the compatibility and changes of a software version.

It consists of three parts: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

MAJOR version changes indicate incompatible updates, MINOR version changes introduce new features without breaking compatibility, and PATCH version changes represent bug fixes without adding new features.

Pre-release and build metadata can also be included for additional information.
